# wialon-external-js
External JS scripts for Wialon pages (login, inside site)
The steps to add ext JS to your site :
1) Put file on some host
2) Request to support@gurtam.com and provide link to the file (step 1) 
You can do any changes in file, save it on your side (where file hosted) without extra request to our support (only if somethig goes wrong)
